> Specialized components are required for effective dual-GPU passthrough:
>
> - Motherboard with dual PCIe slots and IOMMU support.
> - Extra GPU for the guest OS, connected to a secondary monitor for HDR
    support.
> - Extra keyboard and mouse for the guest OS for minimal latency, KVM switch
    also works.
